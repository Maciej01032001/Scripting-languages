[bash_simple_bag_of_words.sh](https://github.com/Maciej01032001/Scripting-languages/blob/main/Bash/bash_simple_bag_of_words.sh) is an old project of mine, which was used as one of the final projects during one of the courses from my studies.

The code used to be entirely in Polish; before uploading it, I translated user messages so that it could be of further use.

To do: 
[ ] Upgrade formatting
